### DUEN - Drink Dispenser

Welcome to Drink Dispenser. This is the website that allows anyone to get access to a mixed drink of their choice based off certain preset choices. For instance, you can get 25% water, 25% juice and much more! Below we have the instructions of how to run the website. This is currently running the frontend.
