### DUEN - Drink Dispenser

Welcome to Drink Dispenser. This is the website that allows anyone to get access to a mixed drink of their choice based off certain preset choices. For instance, you can get 25% water, 25% juice and much more! Below we have the instructions of how to run the website. This is currently running the frontend.

### Language

This was built with a React Typescript Frontend with Tailwind CSS. We are then using an Arduino to connect the frontend of our website to the physical drink dispenser component. In order for this to work, you must first ensure that the Arduino is set to the right IP Address, and ensure that your computer is on the same network as the arduino. This webpage is designed for a phone view.
